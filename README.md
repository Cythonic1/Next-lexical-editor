## Getting Started


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000/editor/[id]](http://localhost:3000/editor/[id]) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
